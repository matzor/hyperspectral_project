\section{Fun but definitely hard problems}

\subsection{Deep learning}

Hyperspectral images contains very large amounts of data, so using a fully connected 
deep learning network would be unfeasible due to the enormous amount of weights and 
nodes required to pass the full-scale image cube. Using this HICO set as an example, 
with dimensions $500 \times 500 \times 100$, totalling 25.000.000 datapoints for the 
input layer alone. This input layer would have to be connected to another layer with 
$N$ nodes, requiring $N \times 25000000$. And thats just for the first layer.
